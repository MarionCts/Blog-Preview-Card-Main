## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to experiment with HTML and CSS fundamentals, like HTML structure and the box model.

### Solution retrospective

For this challenge, I once again focused on a pixel-perfect approach to match the original design as closely as possible. The challenge didn't require a dynamic transition for the hover effect, but I decided to add a basic one anyway, as I found the default HTML hover effect too abrupt. I aim to improve my CSS transitions in future projects.

I wanted to use rem instead of px for the text and make the process easier. So, I set the font size of the HTML element to 10px, allowing me to work with rem more intuitively (e.g., 10px = 1rem, 14px = 1.4rem, etc.), which also improved responsiveness. This approach saved me a lot of time when working with pure HTML and CSS.

I would be grateful for any kind of feedback!
