## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I tried to be as close as possible to the original design. I set a font size of 10px on the HTML element in order to use the rem unit more easily (since 10px = 1 rem, 14px = 1.4rem, etc), thus making the page more responsive. This helped me a lot to gain time in pure HTML/CSS.


### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge on semantic HTML / accessibility elements / writing cleaner code.
